# Complex Device Driver Example for MCAL to RTE Communication

This repository demonstrates a simplified example of complex device drivers communicating
between the MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer) and the RTE (Runtime Environment) in
an AUTOSAR-like architecture.

## Structure

- `mcal/`: Contains CAN driver source and configuration.
- `rte/`: Contains RTE interface for CAN communication.
- `include/`: Common typedefs and definitions.
- `src/main.c`: Example usage and initialization.
- `Makefile`: Build instructions.

## Features

- CAN driver with TX and RX buffer management.
- RTE interface to abstract CAN driver calls.
- Simulated interrupt-driven communication.
- Configurable via `Mcal_Cfg.h`.

## Usage

- Extend drivers to your hardware.
- Integrate with AUTOSAR stack layers.
- Build with `make`.


## üöÄ How to Run

Ensure you have `gcc` installed. Then:

```bash
gcc src/*.c -o diag_test
./diag_test
